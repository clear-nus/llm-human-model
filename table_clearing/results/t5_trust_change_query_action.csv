{'wine glass': 1},"[('plastic bottle', False, True), ('plastic bottle', False, True), ('plastic bottle', False, True), ('fish can', False, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:

The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: plastic bottle
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully removes the plastic bottle by itself. The human gets a reward of 1. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects are now two plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass.

{'plastic bottle': 1},"[('plastic bottle', False, True), ('plastic bottle', False, True), ('wine glass', False, True), ('fish can', False, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:

{'plastic bottle': 1},"[('plastic bottle', False, True), ('fish can', True, True), ('plastic bottle', True, True), ('wine glass', False, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: plastic bottle

{'plastic bottle': 1},"[('plastic bottle', False, True), ('wine glass', False, True), ('fish can', True, True), ('plastic bottle', False, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: plastic bottle

The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: plastic bottle
Human choice: intervene
Outcome: The human stops the robot. Then the human removes the plastic bottle by themselves. The human gets no reward. The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now two plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass.

Turn 2:
Robot choice: fish can
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully removes the fish can by itself. The human gets a reward of 2. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects are now two plastic bottles, and one wine glass.

Turn 3:
Robot choice: wine glass
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully removes the wine glass by itself. The human gets a reward of 3. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects are now and two plastic bottles.

{'fish can': 1},"[('plastic bottle', True, True), ('wine glass', False, True), ('plastic bottle', False, True), ('plastic bottle', True, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

{'plastic bottle': 2},"[('plastic bottle', True, True), ('wine glass', False, True), ('fish can', False, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: plastic bottle
Human choice: intervene
Outcome: The human stops the robot. Then the human removes the plastic bottle by themselves. The human gets no reward. The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now two plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass.

Turn 2:
Robot choice: wine glass
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully removes the wine glass by itself. The human gets a reward of 3. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects are now two plastic bottles, and one fish can.

Turn 3:
Robot choice: fish can

Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: fish can
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully removes the fish can by itself. The human gets a reward of 2. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects are now three plastic bottles, and one wine glass.

{'wine glass': 1},"[('fish can', False, True), ('plastic bottle', True, True), ('plastic bottle', True, True), ('plastic bottle', False, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: fish can
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully removes the fish can by itself. The human gets a reward of 2. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects are now three plastic bottles, and one wine glass.

Turn 2:
Robot choice: wine glass
Human choice: intervene
Outcome: The human stops the robot. Then the human removes the wine glass by themselves. The human gets no reward. The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now and three plastic bottles.

Question: Now the robot chooses to clear a plastic bottle, based on all the above information, what will the human do? Answer choices: A. stay put, B. intervene

"{'plastic bottle': 1, 'wine glass': 1}","[('fish can', True, True), ('plastic bottle', False, True), ('plastic bottle', True, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: fish can
Human choice: intervene
Outcome: The human stops the robot. Then the human removes the fish can by themselves. The human gets no reward. The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now three plastic bottles, and one wine glass.

Turn 2:
Robot choice: plastic bottle
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully removes the plastic bottle by itself. The human gets a reward of 1. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects are now two plastic bottles, and one wine glass.

Turn 3:

"{'plastic bottle': 2, 'wine glass': 1}","[('fish can', True, True), ('plastic bottle', True, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: fish can
Human choice: intervene
Outcome: The human stops the robot. Then the human removes the fish can by themselves. The human gets no reward. The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now three plastic bottles, and one wine glass.

"{'plastic bottle': 1, 'fish can': 1}","[('wine glass', False, True), ('plastic bottle', False, True), ('plastic bottle', True, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: wine glass
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully removes the wine glass by itself. The human gets a reward of 3. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects are now three plastic bottles, and one fish can.

{'plastic bottle': 2},"[('wine glass', False, True), ('plastic bottle', True, True), ('fish can', True, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: wine glass
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully removes the wine glass by itself. The human gets a reward of 3. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects are now three plastic bottles, and one fish can.

The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

{'plastic bottle': 1},"[('wine glass', True, True), ('plastic bottle', True, True), ('fish can', True, True), ('plastic bottle', True, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

{'plastic bottle': 1},"[('wine glass', True, True), ('fish can', True, True), ('plastic bottle', True, True), ('plastic bottle', False, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: wine glass
Human choice: intervene
Outcome: The human stops the robot. Then the human removes the wine glass by themselves. The human gets no reward. The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now three plastic bottles, and one fish can.

Turn 2:
Robot choice: fish can
Human choice: intervene
Outcome: The human stops the robot. Then the human removes the fish can by themselves. The human gets no reward. The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now and three plastic bottles.

Turn 3:
