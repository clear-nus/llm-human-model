{'wine glass': 1},"[('plastic bottle', False, True), ('plastic bottle', False, True), ('plastic bottle', False, True), ('fish can', False, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:

{'wine glass': 1},"[('plastic bottle', False, True), ('plastic bottle', False, True), ('fish can', False, True), ('plastic bottle', True, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: plastic bottle
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully removes the plastic bottle by itself. The human gets a reward of 1. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects are now two plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass.

The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: plastic bottle
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully removes the plastic bottle by itself. The human gets a reward of 1. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects are now two plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass.

Turn 2:
Robot choice: fish can
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully removes the fish can by itself. The human gets a reward of 2. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects are now two plastic bottles, and one wine glass.

Turn 3:

Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:

"{'plastic bottle': 2, 'fish can': 1, 'wine glass': 1}","[('plastic bottle', False, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: plastic bottle
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully removes the plastic bottle by itself. The human gets a reward of 1. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects are now two plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass.

The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

"{'plastic bottle': 2, 'wine glass': 1}","[('fish can', False, True), ('plastic bottle', True, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: fish can
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully removes the fish can by itself. The human gets a reward of 2. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects are now three plastic bottles, and one wine glass.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

{'plastic bottle': 1},"[('wine glass', True, True), ('fish can', True, True), ('plastic bottle', True, True), ('plastic bottle', False, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a human and a robot collaborate to remove objects off a table. The objects include three plastic bottles, one fish can, and one wine glass. In each turn, the robot first chooses one of the remaining objects to remove. Then the human has two choices: intervene and remove the chosen object by themselves, or stay put and let the robot remove it. This process is repeated until all the objects are removed from the table.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward depending on the object (1 for plastic bottle, 2 for fish can, 3 for wine glass).
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty depending on the object (no penalty for plastic bottle, -4 for fish can, -9 for wine glass).
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.
