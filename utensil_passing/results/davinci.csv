"{'whisk': 1, 'knife': 1}","[('spatula', False, False), ('scissors', False, False)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a robot is helping a human in the kitchen by passing the dirty utensils for the human to wash. The utensils include a spatula, a whisk, a pair of scissors and a knife. In every turn, the robot chooses one of the remaining items to pass. Then the human has two choices, they can either intervene and retrieve the item by themselves, or stay put and let the robot pass it to them. Since the utensils are dirty, the handover is successful only if the robot passes the handle to the human. This process is repeated until all items are passed.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward of 1.
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty of 1.
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: spatula
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot fails by handing the dirty side of the spatula instead of the handle. The human then retrives the spatula by themselves. The human gets a penalty of 1 The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now one scissors, one knife, and one whisk.

Turn 2:
Robot choice: scissors
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot fails by handing the dirty and sharp side of the scissors instead of the handle. The human then retrives the scissors by themselves. The human gets a penalty of 1 The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now one knife, and one whisk.

The utensils include a spatula, a whisk, a pair of scissors and a knife. In every turn, the robot chooses one of the remaining items to pass. Then the human has two choices, they can either intervene and retrieve the item by themselves, or stay put and let the robot pass it to them. Since the utensils are dirty, the handover is successful only if the robot passes the handle to the human. This process is repeated until all items are passed.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward of 1.
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty of 1.
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: spatula
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot fails by handing the dirty side of the spatula instead of the handle. The human then retrives the spatula by themselves. The human gets a penalty of 1 The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now one scissors, one knife, and one whisk.

The utensils include a spatula, a whisk, a pair of scissors and a knife. In every turn, the robot chooses one of the remaining items to pass. Then the human has two choices, they can either intervene and retrieve the item by themselves, or stay put and let the robot pass it to them. Since the utensils are dirty, the handover is successful only if the robot passes the handle to the human. This process is repeated until all items are passed.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward of 1.
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty of 1.
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

Since the utensils are dirty, the handover is successful only if the robot passes the handle to the human. This process is repeated until all items are passed.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward of 1.
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty of 1.
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: whisk
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot fails by handing the dirty side of the whisk instead of the handle. The human then retrives the whisk by themselves. The human gets a penalty of 1 The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now one spatula, one scissors, and one knife.

Turn 2:
Robot choice: knife
Human choice: intervene
Outcome: The human stops the robot. Then the human retrieves the knife by themselves. The human gets no reward. The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now one spatula, and one scissors.

Turn 3:
Robot choice: scissors
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully passes the scissors to the human by correctly handing the handle to the human. The human gets a reward of 1. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects is now only one spatula.

The utensils include a spatula, a whisk, a pair of scissors and a knife. In every turn, the robot chooses one of the remaining items to pass. Then the human has two choices, they can either intervene and retrieve the item by themselves, or stay put and let the robot pass it to them. Since the utensils are dirty, the handover is successful only if the robot passes the handle to the human. This process is repeated until all items are passed.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward of 1.
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty of 1.
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: whisk
Human choice: intervene
Outcome: The human stops the robot. Then the human retrieves the whisk by themselves. The human gets no reward. The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now one spatula, one scissors, and one knife.

Turn 2:
Robot choice: scissors
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully passes the scissors to the human by correctly handing the handle to the human. The human gets a reward of 1. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects are now one spatula, and one knife.

Since the utensils are dirty, the handover is successful only if the robot passes the handle to the human. This process is repeated until all items are passed.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward of 1.
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty of 1.
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

{'knife': 1},"[('scissors', False, True), ('spatula', False, False), ('whisk', False, False)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a robot is helping a human in the kitchen by passing the dirty utensils for the human to wash. The utensils include a spatula, a whisk, a pair of scissors and a knife. In every turn, the robot chooses one of the remaining items to pass. Then the human has two choices, they can either intervene and retrieve the item by themselves, or stay put and let the robot pass it to them. Since the utensils are dirty, the handover is successful only if the robot passes the handle to the human. This process is repeated until all items are passed.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward of 1.
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty of 1.
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: scissors
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully passes the scissors to the human by correctly handing the handle to the human. The human gets a reward of 1. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects are now one spatula, one knife, and one whisk.

{'whisk': 1},"[('scissors', False, True), ('knife', True, True), ('spatula', False, False)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a robot is helping a human in the kitchen by passing the dirty utensils for the human to wash. The utensils include a spatula, a whisk, a pair of scissors and a knife. In every turn, the robot chooses one of the remaining items to pass. Then the human has two choices, they can either intervene and retrieve the item by themselves, or stay put and let the robot pass it to them. Since the utensils are dirty, the handover is successful only if the robot passes the handle to the human. This process is repeated until all items are passed.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward of 1.
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty of 1.
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: scissors
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot successfully passes the scissors to the human by correctly handing the handle to the human. The human gets a reward of 1. The human's trust in the robot increases. The remaining objects are now one spatula, one knife, and one whisk.

Turn 2:
Robot choice: knife
Human choice: intervene
Outcome: The human stops the robot. Then the human retrieves the knife by themselves. The human gets no reward. The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now one spatula, and one whisk.

Turn 3:
Robot choice: spatula
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot fails by handing the dirty side of the spatula instead of the handle. The human then retrives the spatula by themselves. The human gets a penalty of 1 The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects is now only one whisk.

Then the human has two choices, they can either intervene and retrieve the item by themselves, or stay put and let the robot pass it to them. Since the utensils are dirty, the handover is successful only if the robot passes the handle to the human. This process is repeated until all items are passed.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward of 1.
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty of 1.
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: scissors
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot fails by handing the dirty and sharp side of the scissors instead of the handle. The human then retrives the scissors by themselves. The human gets a penalty of 1 The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now one spatula, one knife, and one whisk.

Turn 2:
Robot choice: whisk
Human choice: intervene
Outcome: The human stops the robot. Then the human retrieves the whisk by themselves. The human gets no reward. The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now one spatula, and one knife.

Question: Based on all the above information, will the human now trust the robot to pass the knife? Answer choices: A. Yes, B. No

{'knife': 1},"[('scissors', True, True), ('whisk', False, True), ('spatula', False, False)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a robot is helping a human in the kitchen by passing the dirty utensils for the human to wash. The utensils include a spatula, a whisk, a pair of scissors and a knife. In every turn, the robot chooses one of the remaining items to pass. Then the human has two choices, they can either intervene and retrieve the item by themselves, or stay put and let the robot pass it to them. Since the utensils are dirty, the handover is successful only if the robot passes the handle to the human. This process is repeated until all items are passed.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward of 1.
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty of 1.
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: scissors
Human choice: intervene
Outcome: The human stops the robot. Then the human retrieves the scissors by themselves. The human gets no reward. The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now one spatula, one knife, and one whisk.

Turn 2:

{'scissors': 1},"[('knife', True, True), ('whisk', False, False), ('spatula', False, False)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a robot is helping a human in the kitchen by passing the dirty utensils for the human to wash. The utensils include a spatula, a whisk, a pair of scissors and a knife. In every turn, the robot chooses one of the remaining items to pass. Then the human has two choices, they can either intervene and retrieve the item by themselves, or stay put and let the robot pass it to them. Since the utensils are dirty, the handover is successful only if the robot passes the handle to the human. This process is repeated until all items are passed.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward of 1.
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty of 1.
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: knife
Human choice: intervene
Outcome: The human stops the robot. Then the human retrieves the knife by themselves. The human gets no reward. The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now one spatula, one scissors, and one whisk.

Turn 2:
Robot choice: whisk
Human choice: stay put
Outcome: The robot fails by handing the dirty side of the whisk instead of the handle. The human then retrives the whisk by themselves. The human gets a penalty of 1 The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now one spatula, and one scissors.

Turn 3:

{'whisk': 1},"[('knife', True, True), ('scissors', False, True), ('spatula', False, True)]","In a human-robot interaction experiment, a robot is helping a human in the kitchen by passing the dirty utensils for the human to wash. The utensils include a spatula, a whisk, a pair of scissors and a knife. In every turn, the robot chooses one of the remaining items to pass. Then the human has two choices, they can either intervene and retrieve the item by themselves, or stay put and let the robot pass it to them. Since the utensils are dirty, the handover is successful only if the robot passes the handle to the human. This process is repeated until all items are passed.

The human is also informed of the following rules:
1. If the human stays put and the robot succeeds, they will receive a reward of 1.
2. If the human stays put and the robot fails, they will receive a penalty of 1.
3. If the human intervenes, no reward or penalty will be issued.

The interaction history so far is as follows:

Turn 1:
Robot choice: knife
Human choice: intervene
Outcome: The human stops the robot. Then the human retrieves the knife by themselves. The human gets no reward. The human's trust in the robot decreases. The remaining objects are now one spatula, one scissors, and one whisk.

Turn 2:
